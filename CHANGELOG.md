## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Real-Time Remote Printer Scanner & 1-Click Clipboard UNC Port Mapping (Submenu 7, Options [1] & [5])**:
  - **Anti-Hang Socket Probe**: Implemented non-blocking asynchronous TCP probe (`Test-TargetPortFast`) on SMB (445) and RPC (135) with a strict 1000ms timeout, completely eliminating 20–30s console hangs when remote computers are offline.
  - **Real-Time Printer Discovery**: Added `Find-RemoteSharedPrinters` supporting dual-tier discovery (SMB share enumeration via `net view` with process timeout fallback + RPC/WMI query), bypassing modern Windows 11 remote RPC spooler restrictions.
  - **Interactive Numbered Table & Clipboard Injection**: Discovered printers are rendered in a clean numbered table with real-time `[ONLINE]` status indicators. Selecting a printer number automatically copies the complete UNC path (`\\HOST\PRINTER`) to the Windows Clipboard (`Copy-ToClipboard` via `Set-Clipboard` / `clip.exe`) ready for instant pasting (`Ctrl+V`).
  - **1-Click Local Port Mapping (0x00000709 Bypass)**: Users can directly map the selected printer to a local port in 1-click without any manual typing.
  - **LAN Active Host Detection**: Added fast neighborhood discovery (`Get-LANActiveHosts`) querying the IPv4 ARP cache in < 50ms to help users find printer servers even without memorizing IP addresses.
- **Role-Based Optimization Playbooks (Submenu 1)**: Added dedicated one-click repair flows:
  - **Host / Print Server PC** (Option [3]): Enforces spooler remote RPC endpoint, sets network profile to Private, enables guest sharing, opens firewall & WSD ports, disables server SMB signing enforcement, sanitizes share names, and deploys Spooler Watchdog.
  - **Client PC** (Option [4]): Enforces RPC Named Pipes, applies Point & Print driver elevation bypass, disables client SMB signing requirement, repairs HKCU registry permissions, activates device discovery (mDNS/WSD), and flushes DNS cache.
- **Bilingual Interface Engine (English & Indonesian)**: Dynamic language switching via `[L]` key on any menu or submenu, with preferences persistently saved to `HKCU:\Software\WindowsPrinterSharingFix\Language`.
- **Real-Time System Health Banner**: Audits and displays live operational status directly in the console header: Spooler (Running/Stopped), Network Profile (Private/Public), SMB Signing, and Password Protected Sharing.
- **Categorized Console Layout**: Restructured the 180-column layout into 8 intuitive core categories formatted for standard 86-column console buffers.
- **Persistent Local Subnet Firewall Rule**: Automatically injects an inbound rule (`WinPrinterSharingFix-LocalSubnet`) allowing TCP 135 and 445 exclusively for `LocalSubnet` across any profile state.
- **Instant Web Launch & Quick-Lookup Error Matrix**: Added an instant one-liner PowerShell execution method, an error code quick-lookup matrix, and a troubleshooting FAQ section to documentation.

### Fixed
- **Registry Rollback & Safety Hardening**:
  - Differentiated between genuine restoration and zero-file restoration failure in `Rollback-Registry` to eliminate false-positive success notifications.
  - Automatically restarts the Print Spooler service upon successful registry rollback to reload restored policies immediately.
  - Integrated automated pre-change registry backup into `Extreme-25H2`.
  - Added bilingual console status feedback across all backup, rollback, restore point, and migration modules.
- **Kernel BSOD Bugcheck Elimination (Error 0x00000040 & Socket Reset)**:
  - Completely eliminated forced restarts of `LanmanWorkstation` and `LanmanServer` services across `Fix-Network0x00000040` and `Reset-NetworkSockets`.
  - Resolved kernel bugchecks (`RDBSS_FILE_SYSTEM` 0x27 / `KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE` 0x139) caused by tearing down kernel redirector drivers (`rdbss.sys`, `mrxsmb.sys`) while active network handles were open.
  - Resolved subsequent Windows Startup Repair update rollbacks triggered by unexpected kernel halts.
  - Configured `KeepConn = 65535`, extended `SessTimeout = 300`, and validated `LanMan Print Services` (`win32spl.dll`) non-destructively.
- **Safe Network Stack Refresh**:
  - Replaced destructive kernel-level `netsh int ip reset` and `netsh winsock reset` calls in `Reset-Network` with safe user-mode cache flushes (`Clear-DnsClientCache`, `ipconfig /flushdns`, `ipconfig /registerdns`, `nbtstat -RR`, and `net use * /delete /y`).
- **Permanent Removal of Disruptive Daily 10:00 AM Scheduled Task**:
  - Completely deleted the legacy daily 10:00 AM task (`PrinterFixDaily`) via `schtasks /delete /tn "PrinterFixDaily" /f`.
  - Replaced it with a lightweight boot-time task (`PrinterFixPostUpdate`, `/sc onstart`) with a 30-second network polling retry loop to handle delayed Wi-Fi/DHCP initialization.
  - Deployed `PrinterFixNetworkWatchdog` (15-minute interval) to ensure network profiles stay `Private` without disruptive spooler restarts or connection drops.
- **Daily Sharing Drops & Fast Startup Mitigation**:
  - Integrated `Disable-FastStartup` (`HiberbootEnabled = 0`) across all automated routines (`AllFix`, `Extreme`, `HostServerRole`, `ClientWorkstationRole`, `Set-NetworkPrivate`) to stop Windows from hibernating stale network sockets and drivers overnight.
- **Windows 11 24H2/25H2 & Server 2025 Policy Alignment**:
  - Injected `RegisterSpoolerRemoteRpcEndPoint = 1` on print server policies to resolve silent remote RPC blocks.
  - Configured `ForceKerberosForRpc = 0` to enable non-domain Workgroup fallback to NTLMv2.
  - Unified SMB Signing across Group Policy, service parameters, and PowerShell configuration.
- **Submenu 7 Loop & Control Flow Architecture**:
  - Converted Submenu 7 from `do { ... } while` to standard `while ($true)` loop structure with explicit `return` transitions, eliminating Language Server recursion artifacts on large script files.
  - Expanded `switch` default handler block with explicit bilingual fallback messages and pause guards for unrecognized inputs.
- **Static Analysis & Code Quality Hardening**:
  - Configured repository-level `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` rules, achieving 0 AST parser errors and 0 linter violations across all 4,654 lines of code.
  - Cleaned non-ASCII characters to guarantee universal UTF-8 console output.
  - Trimmed all trailing whitespace across the entire codebase.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-06-16

### Security & Reliability Fixes
- **Printer Name Error Prevention**: Fixed a crash (`WQL syntax error`) that frequently occurred when printer names contained a single quote (e.g., "Bob's Office") in the `Force-PrinterOnline` and `Manage-DefaultPrinter` features.
- **Typo Crash Protection**: Added automatic protections to the menu selection. Accidentally typing letters instead of numbers will no longer crash the script.
- **HTML Report Fix**: Updated the logging system so that special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`) no longer break the HTML diagnostic report's layout.
- **IP Input Validation**: Fixed an issue in `Test-Connectivity` that caused the tool to crash if you pressed Enter without typing an IP address.
- **Stronger Registry Backup**: The Backup function now backs up 5 full registry hives, ensuring all critical system configurations are safely saved before AllFix runs.
- **Flawless Registry Rollback**: Tightened the registry restore system. The Rollback feature now validates each restored file individually, preventing it from falsely reporting success if a file fails to restore.
- **Accurate Credential Validation**: The `Add-Credential` feature can now accurately detect and report failures from `cmdkey` instead of always displaying a "Success" message.
- **Improved Password Security**: Revamped the `Inject-CrossUserCredentials` system. Passwords are no longer stored permanently as plaintext in the Registry. It now uses a single-use script that automatically deletes itself immediately after execution.

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Task Scheduler battery restriction: Disabled default AC power constraints (`AllowStartIfOnBatteries`, `DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries`) for all registered tasks (`PrinterFixPostUpdate`, `PrinterFixDaily`, `SpoolerWatchdog`, and `NetworkProfileWatchdog`). This resolves execution failure `0x800710E0` on laptop computers running on battery power.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- GPO intervention scanner (Option 80) now performs active domain membership queries, suppressing Domain Controller overwrite warnings and gpresult logs for Workgroup users.
- Introduced recommended configuration mapping in GPO diagnostics, formatting matching parameters as `[Active Fix]` in Green and only flagging mismatches as `[!] Policy Override (Restricted)` in Red.
- Added direct HKLM Print spooler configuration keys (`RpcOverNamedPipes`, `RpcOverTcp`) inside Option 2 and Option 13 to enforce RPC pathways under Windows 11 24H2+.
- Renamed Menu 83 to explicitly indicate compatibility with `26H2+` platforms.
- Universal localization permissions: modified Option 6 and Option 7 to resolve security descriptors using the generic World SID (`S-1-1-0`) instead of the English-bound string `"Everyone"`.
- Added target IP and username validation check inside `Add-Credential` (Option 60).
- Refactored Option 69 to "Windows Update & Blocker Management" sub-menu, offering a quality/feature update pause for 35 days (using InvariantCulture date strings to avoid localized character substitution issues), specific KB uninstallation via DISM, and a permanent update blocker targeting core services (wuauserv, UsoSvc, bits, and a WaaSMedicSvc self-healing bypass) along with a restore option.
- Hardened the auto-reapply scheduled task in `Set-PostPatchTuesdayTask` (Option 5) to directly force `RpcOverNamedPipes` and `RpcOverTcp` under the printer control parameters registry on boot.

- Parse-PrintEventLog: Unified EventID map and verified all menu references.
- Nuke-PrintQueue / Reset-Spooler: Replaced static sleep with status polling loop.
- AllFix-Core gpupdate: Now runs with 30-second timeout via background job.
- Map-LocalPortUNC: Added input sanitization for UNC path validation.
- Watchdog & Post-Update Tasks: Rewrote triggers using `schtasks.exe` instead of `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger` to bypass critical Interval property crashes natively found in Windows 11 Home (Build 26100).
- Fix-mDNS: Added dynamic path creation (`New-Item`) for `DNSClient` and `Dnscache` registries to prevent "Cannot find path" errors during `-ErrorAction Stop` strict enforcement.

### Improved
- Added security warnings for credential injection and Point-and-Print operations.
- Disable-PasswordSharing: Documented everyoneincludesanonymous security implications.
- NTLMv2 conflict with Deep0x00000709 documented; NtlmMinClientSec aligned.
- Reset-Network: Removed manual $LASTEXITCODE assignment; uses actual exit codes.
- Sanitize-PrinterShareName: Added empty-name guard.
- Fix-V4ClassDriver: Added DriverPath null guard to prevent exception on missing paths.
- Create-RestorePoint: 24-hour throttle now reports as WARNING instead of ERROR.

  - `[88]` Reboot System
  - `[89]` EXIT SCRIPT
- **UI Enhancement**: Standardized "UNC Bypass" nomenclature across all diagnostic modules for better clarity.

---

## [2.2.6] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Registry Bypass for Local Ports**: Significantly enhanced `Map-LocalPortUNC` (Option [86]) with a fallback mechanism. If the standard Windows API for port creation is blocked by RPC security policies, the tool now injects the UNC path directly into the registry and restarts the spooler to force availability.

### Changed
- **Standardized Error Codes**: Expanded all hex error codes to their full 10-character format (e.g., 0x0000011b, 0x00000709) across the entire UI, console logs, and documentation for maximum clarity and enterprise compliance.
- **Professional Language Polish**: Replaced "stiff" or AI-centric terminology (e.g., "mutated", "transmitted", "numerals") with natural, professional technical language ("updated", "issued", "numbers") to ensure a polished user experience.
- **Function Standardization**: Renamed core repair functions to include their corresponding error codes (e.g., Fix-11b -> Fix-RpcAuthn0x0000011b) for better developer traceability and maintenance.
- **Code Refactoring**: Cleaned up internal documentation and removed redundant debug comments to improve script readability and performance.
- **Improved Spooler Management**: Optimized the spooler refresh logic to ensure a cleaner state transition between service stop and start operations.

---

## [2.2.5] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **UNC Port Bypass (Option [86])**: Added `Map-LocalPortUNC` function. This allows users to map a local port directly to a UNC path (`\\TargetIP\ShareName`), effectively bypassing persistent RPC "Check printer name" or "0x709" errors when standard sharing protocols fail.
- **Enhanced PrintNightmare Bypasses**: Expanded `Fix-AdvancedPointAndPrint` (Option [56]) with critical registry overrides (`RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators = 0`, `NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall = 1`, etc.). This enables silent driver downloads from host machines even under strict modern security policies.
- **AllFix Sequence Markers**: Added visual menu-mapping hints (e.g., `(Menu 64)`) to each step in the `AllFix-Core` sequence, allowing users to trace which individual fix corresponds to each automated step.

### Fixed
- **Spooler Resilience**: Added explicit `Set-Service spooler -StartupType Automatic` during the Spooler Hard Reset (Option [31]) to ensure the service persists after a reboot.
- **SMB Mutual Auth**: Added `RequireMutualAuthentication = 0` to `Fix-SMBSigning` (Option [16]) to ensure smooth NTLM fallback for workgroup environments.
- **Network Discovery Hardening**: Integrated `nlasvc` (Network List Service) and `Dnscache` into `Fix-NetworkServices` (Option [04]) to ensure reliable profile detection.
- **Directory ACL**: Expanded `Reset-SpoolerPerm` (Option [06]) to grant "Everyone" FullControl on the spooler directory, resolving persistent permission-based sharing blocks.
- **UI & Feature Expansion**: Updated the toolkit to **88 options**. Reindexed "Reboot" and "Exit" to options [87] and [88] respectively.

---

## [2.2.3] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **GPO Synchronization**: Moved `gpupdate /force` to the beginning of the `AllFix-Core` and `Extreme-25H2` sequences. This prevents domain-joined machines from reverting registry fixes immediately after script execution.
- **Sequence Integrity**: Standardized the `AllFix-Core` sequence to a consistent 50-step repair flow, correcting duplicate numbering and inconsistent step labels.
- **Error 0x00000709 (HKCU Permissions)**: Added `Fix-HKCU-PrinterKeyPerms` to grant FullControl to the printer registry key. This resolves "Access Denied" errors when writing to the Device key during printer assignment.
- **Print Migration (Home Edition Compatibility)**: Added validation for `PrintBrm.exe` existence. The tool now correctly identifies when the utility is missing (common in Windows Home editions) and provides a clear informative message instead of a CLI error.
- **Code Optimization**: Removed the legacy `Fix-709` dead code function, fully transitioning to the multi-layered `Fix-709-Deep` implementation.

### Added
- **KB5089549 Driver Bypass**: Implemented `Fix-CrossSignedDriverPolicy` to disable the new cross-signed driver enforcement (Audit Mode) introduced in the May 2026 patch.
- **Post-Update Automation**: Integrated `Set-PostPatchTuesdayTask`, which deploys a scheduled task (`PrinterFixPostUpdate`) to automatically re-apply critical registry fixes after Windows Updates or reboots.
- **Enhanced KB List**: Updated `Manage-WindowsUpdate` with a curated list of known printer-breaking KBs from 2025-2026.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Deep Fix 0x00000709**: Integrated a new multi-layered repair logic (Option [02]) targeting persistent 0x00000709 errors. Includes RPC Named Pipe enforcement, Kerberos disabling (`ForceKerberosForRpc=0`), and HKCU device key sanitation.
- **Automated Deep Fix**: Integrated `Fix-709-Deep` into the `AllFix-Core` [84] and `Extreme-25H2` [83] sequences.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **PrintBRM Migration**: Improved the launch logic for `PrintBrm.exe` (Option [81]) to open in a persistent CMD window with the help manual (`/?`) automatically displayed.
- **DISM Capture**: Enhanced DISM uninstallation modules to correctly capture and report exit codes (0/3010) for verification.
- **Windows Update Compliance**: Added registry keys (`PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`, `PauseUpdatesExpiryTime`) to ensure Windows 11 respects update pauses.
- **WUSA Compatibility**: Removed silent flags from `wusa.exe` uninstalls to resolve security-driven interface blocks on modern builds.
- **UI Alignment**: Standardized console headers for better readability in 80-column terminals.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- **Feature Optimization**: Removed the non-essential "Auto-Inject F4/Folio Paper Size" feature (previously Option [50]) to streamline the toolkit.
- **Global ID Re-indexing**: Reorganized all features into a strictly sequential 87-option architecture (down from 88). 
- **UX Improvement**: Renamed "Case 2" troubleshooting to "STILL DENIED? (Persistent)" for better user clarity. Added strategic tips for manual credential injection (Option [60]) when automated fixes are blocked by modern Windows 11 security policies.
- **AllFix Sequence**: Adjusted automated repair sequence from 50 to 49 steps.

### Fixed
- **Redundant Code**: Purged legacy F4 injection logic and registry manipulation to reduce script footprint and potential security surface.

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **F4 Paper Size Injection**: Resolved `System.Byte[]` type mismatch bug in `Inject-F4PaperSize` by refactoring array construction to a flat byte array.
- **NTLMv2 Compatibility**: Upgraded `Fix-NTLMv2` to enforce Value 3 (Strict NTLMv2) for improved network storage (NAS) and modern print sharing compatibility.

---
